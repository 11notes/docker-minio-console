Run minio-console rootless and distroless.

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

[MinIO Console](https://github.com/huncrys/minio-console) (created by [huncrys](https://github.com/huncrys/)) is a library that provides a management and browser UI overlay for the MinIO Server.

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will run minio-console [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md), for maximum security and performance. In addition to being small and secure, it will also automatically create the required user with the required privileges to access minio for you.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [1.8.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/minio-console/tags?name=1.8.1)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:1.8.1``` you can use ```:1``` or ```:1.8```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# PARENT IMAGE üèõÔ∏è
> [!IMPORTANT]
>This image is not based on another image but uses [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) as the starting layer.
>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/arch.dockerfile) - contains users, timezones and Root CA certificates, nothing else
>* [11notes/distroless:localhealth](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/localhealth.dockerfile) - app to execute HTTP requests only on 127.0.0.1
>* [11notes/distroless:mc](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/mc.dockerfile) - app to manage minio

# BUILT WITH üß∞
* [huncrys/minio-console](https://github.com/huncrys/minio-console)

# GENERAL TIPS üìå
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services

# CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
> [!CAUTION]
>* The compose example uses ```MC_INSECURE```. Never do this in production! Use a valid SSL certificate to terminate your minio!
